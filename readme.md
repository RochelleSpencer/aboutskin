#Beams v0.1.1 (Beta)

Beams is an open, full-stack framework for building media websites, including news sites, blogs, video apps, and so on. 

This version consolidates what had previously been three separate code repos -- a server module, an ultraresponsive front-end grid, and a plugin for ad display and metrics. The idea is that by putting it all together, in one place, developers will find it much easier to use Beams in their projects.
